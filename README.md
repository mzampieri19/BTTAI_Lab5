# BTTAI_Lab5
Code for Lab5 of Break Through Tech AI 2024

This jupyter notebook includes the work I did for Lab5 for BTTAI, this serves as a great review of most of the topics covered in this session of BTTAI, covers dataframes, model fitting, model selection, cross-validation, grid search, and ROC-AUC. I did have some trouble with uploading downloading to pickle and I was not able to resolve that issue.
