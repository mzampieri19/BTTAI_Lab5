Labs for Break Through Tech AI 2024

This repository includes all the labs I did for BTTAI, an introductory course to machine learning and AI at MIT though eCornell. 

- Lab 1- Business Understanding: This lab focused on understanding the python tools and language, and formulating a business plan for a machine leaning model for a given problem.

- Lab 2- Data Preparation: Deep doved into common data preperation techniques used in machine learning to prepare the data metrix to be used in modeling. 

- Lab 3- Modeling_KNN: This lab was the first introduction to modeling, prepared, trained, and analyzed a simple KNN model.  

- Lab 4- Modeling_LogisticRegression: Second modeling lab this time worked with a logistic regression model, prepared, trained and analyzed a logistic regression model. 

- Lab 5- Evaluation_Deployment: This lab focused on adjusting hyper-parameters in a Logistic Regression model using a grid search to optimize accuracy. 

- Lab 6- Various Models: Compare and contrasted different types of machine learning models to see how their accuracies differ.  

- Lab 7- CNNs: Third model of the class CNNs, prepared, trained, and analyzed a simple CNN model to predict handwritten numbers. 

- Lab 8- World Happiness: For this project we were given various data sets to choose from to create a machine learning model of our choosing. This project first prepares the data, then features a logistic regression of the worlds happiness score based on various features, then the model is optimized using a grid search.
